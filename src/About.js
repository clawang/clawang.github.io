						<h1>Hi, I'm Claire.</h1>
						<p>I'm a developer, designer, photographer, blogger, and all around creative type. I'm currently studying Computer Science at NYU and minoring in Web Programming & Applications and Business of Entertainment, Media, and Technology.</p>
						<p>Although I have many varied interests, I think all of them stem from my desire to better facilitate communication; to help brands reach their customers and to help people reach their peers. Because real, authentic connections are what shape our technologies, our brands, and our everyday lives.</p>
						<p>In my free time, I run a travel blog, dabble in photography, and spend all my money on brunch.</p>
